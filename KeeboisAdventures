Creating a Pax Wicket application

Create a wicket application via Apache Wicket Quickstart - http://wicket.apache.org/start/quickstart.html

	Note: Make sure you select the proper wicket version (in our case, 1.5.7 since 6.0.3-BETA is not yet supported). Also, dubstep has some sick tunes to listen to while you setup Pax Wicket and all the other crap.

After maven is done creating the archetype, edit the pom.xml and add the following dependencies:

	<!-- Pax Wicket Core -->
	<dependency>
	  <groupId>org.ops4j.pax.wicket</groupId>
	  <artifactId>org.ops4j.pax.wicket.service</artifactId>
	  <version>1.0.1</version>
	</dependency>
	<!-- Pax Wicket Test Utilities -->
	<dependency>
	  <groupId>org.ops4j.pax.wicket</groupId>
	  <artifactId>org.ops4j.pax.wicket.test</artifactId>
	  <version>1.0.1</version>
	</dependency>

PAX WICKET DEPENDENCIES BROS, das what I'm tawkin' bouuut.

	Note: If your working behind a very annoying proxy, make sure you configure maven to point to your proxy Maven settings (Ubuntu 12.04) can be found in 

		/etc/maven2/settings.xml 

	Apache is kind enough to give us a template to edit.

	Once you've finished configuring your maven settings, configure your Karaf mvn settings to point to your mvn settings (settings-ception). You can find it in:

		${YOUR-FREAKIN'-KARAF-DIRECTORY}/etc/org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.cfg (edit it with Vi if you're a real man)

	I spent an hour trying to figure out why I couldn't do the next step. Proxies are truly productivity killers.

Right, so now time to add the Pax Wicket repo to Karaf, start your Karaf ${YOUR-FREAKIN'-KARAF-DIRECTORY}/bin/karaf and add the following:

		features:addurl mvn:org.ops4j.pax.wicket/features/1.0.1/xml/features
		features:addurl mvn:org.ops4j.pax.wicket.samples/features/1.0.1/xml/features

	Note: I'm using Pax Wicket 1.0.1 (which uses Wicket 1.5.7) check http://team.ops4j.org/wiki/display/paxwicket/Download for the appropriate version. Unfortunately, Wicket 6.x.x-Beta aint supported yet bros.

	To check if you've properly added the repos to your Karaf setup, run the command 

		features:list 

	should give you these buggers:

		... some other features and stuff
		[uninstalled] [1.0.1] wicket-samples-base                       pax-wicket-samples-features-1.0.1 
		[uninstalled] [1.0.1] wicket-samples-plain-simple               pax-wicket-samples-features-1.0.1 
		[uninstalled] [1.0.1] wicket-samples-blueprint-simple           pax-wicket-samples-features-1.0.1 
		[uninstalled] [1.0.1] wicket-samples-blueprint-wicketproperties pax-wicket-samples-features-1.0.1

		[uninstalled] [1.0.1] wicket                                    pax-wicket-features-1.0.1         
		[uninstalled] [1.0.1] wicket-spring                             pax-wicket-features-1.0.1         

	Got it bros? Good.

BREAK-FREAKIN'-TIME BROS

	Here's a rundown on what we've done:
		1.) We created a Pax Wicket application
		2.) We added Pax Wicket stuff to our Karaf setup
		3.) We listened to dubstep and became real men

Aight, let's bounce:

	Install the wicket feature by running the command:

		features:install wicket
		features:install wicket-spring

Now let's go back to our Wicket application
